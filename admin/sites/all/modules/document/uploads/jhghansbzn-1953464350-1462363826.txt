Here are a few more things that have to be done on Jungle Drones as well
They need a page up top far right says 


"Employment"


Show pictures of jungle drone pilots
then big words


WE ARE HIRING PILOTS!


Come and work for an incredible company that is bringing a breaking industry to the world. If you are interested flying for us as a pilot please fill out this form and apply today!


first name 
last name 
telephone 
email 
country 
city
then a file upload called "resume"














Then they want the member sign up back in the top navigation (second to last) and whenever it is clicked it shoots back to the home page and down to a bookmark where they fill out that form
the form needs to have country (dropdown if you have it, defaulted to Belize) then city as well please
in any case we are still on super high priority for Jungle Drones please try to get all of this and what Lannah sent done today
